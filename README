# Guilds (Spigot 1.14)

Guilds is the new and (hopefully) improved version of good old factions, raiding, economy, player bounties, auctions. You get it, all that good stuff, but with several twists, built entirely from scratch on the Spigot API.

Oh yeah, it is also 1.14 (shock horror) watch how it makes the actual PvP element fun and encourages the community aspect itself. 

## Plugin Concept

The full concept itself is under wraps and certain files have been purposefully revoked for certain reasons.
As of writing this is in incredibly early development and is here more for portfolio purposes, 
updated here and there, meh, cloning it in won't do you much help as all commits have varying fatal flaws and missing essential components.

#### Not even I know how often this shall be updated.


Either way, let's have a go at changing the common play set of factions and how it has been for literal years given the up in Minecraft's popularity recently.

$mat exit
